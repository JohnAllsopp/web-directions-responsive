			<section class=description>
<p>"We're not designing pages anymore. We're designing systems of components." As with most things Stephen Hay says, he's right. Over the past few years, we've witnessed an explosion of Web-enabled devices, and that explosion has forced the Web community to embrace a more systematic approach to designing interfaces.</p>

<p>This full-day workshop will take a deep dive into the world of responsive web design, how to deconstruct interfaces down to their atomic elements, and how to introduce design systems into your workflow. We'll look at a ton of emerging responsive patterns, new tools and resources to help you design multi-device Web experiences. Sound like fun? We hope so!</p>

<h4>What you'll learn</h4>
<ul>
	<li>An overview of the ever-shifting Web landscape</li>
	<li>The fundamentals of responsive design and the principles of adaptive design</li>
	<li>The atomic design methodology and implementing atomic design with Pattern Lab</li>
	<li>The modern design workflow: process, techniques and tools</li>
	<li>The pros and cons of many emerging responsive design patterns</li>

			</h3>
			
			<section class=description>
				<p>Everyone knows client-side applications are built with JavaScript. Right? JavaScript ties the application together, but a considerable amount of most applications deals with markup and presentation. As much as they affect JavaScript, state, event handling, and default browser behaviour also impact HTML and CSS in the choices we make, optimizations we can take advantage of, and the architecture of our applications as a whole. And the HTML and CSS that make up the structure of our applications need to be managed just as much as our JavaScript does. We&rsquo;ll talk about how HTML and CSS fit into the the big picture and how to take greater advantage of them in a context where we frequently consider them last.</p>

				<p>As web developers, our work builds on the the conventions of REST, whether we know it or not. By getting to know these conventions, we can design websites and web APIs that are faster and easier for other developers to learn and navigate. Using real-world examples, this talk will introduce REST from a front-end developer&rsquo;s perspective, explain how to handle the typical problems that arise, and point to current trends and limitations of the protocol.</p>

			</h3>
			
			<section class=description>
				<p>These days, modern web design offers some fantastic new ways of building highly responsive apps using asynchronous services called directly from the browser. We now regularly create and consume services which we never directly see in the address bar, rather they're consumed in the background by the likes of JavaScript and rich client mobile apps. But are you properly securing all those fancy new asynchronous requests? Just because they're not as visible as traditional webpages doesn't mean they're any less vulnerable to attackers.</p>
				<p>In fact it's often the opposite; web service security is frequently neglected as the service is "out of sight, out of mind" and we're increasingly seeing these exploited by attackers as their popularity increases. Let's take a look at what it takes to build secure services, how to easily find the ones that aren't and then what an attacker might do to exploit those that remain vulnerable.</p>

			</h3>
			
			<section class=description>
				<p>Node.js takes the asynchronous nature of browser-side JavaScript and extends it to the server. While a little bit of asynchronous in the browser never hurt anybody, going head-on with asynchronous programming on the server may put you in a whole lot of pain. At its best, server-side asynchronous programming has a significant pay-off: a blazing fast and highly scalable back-end. However, it's not for the faint-hearted, for if you're not careful you can end up with your head spinning in a bowl of spaghetti code. This presentation will explore the asynchronous workings of Node.js, describe asynchronous application code patterns, and show how to leverage asynchronous libraries to build scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.</p>

			</h3>
			
			<section class=description>
				<p>Mobile devices are amazing things. Not only can you use them to make phone calls, but they are jammed full of interesting sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and GPS chips. These amazing components not only tell you where you are on the planet but also the direction you're facing and how many G&rsquo;s you happen to be pulling as you ride the tram on the way to work.
				</p>
				<p>And all of this is now available in the web browser through the Device API. In this short session we&rsquo;ll look at how to get access to the orientation and motion data available to the mobile browser. Rather than just using it to turn your page the right way up no matter which way you&rsquo;re holding the device, we&rsquo;ll look at how to use these APIs to create applications with new input methods based on sensor data as well as user interaction.</p>

			<section class=description>
				<p>When building a website aimed at desktop users you have a myriad of methods for testing, trialing and debugging problems as well as tweaking them in real time to instantly see the affects of your changes. Whilst mobile web apps can be a fantastic time saver, trying to quickly view the changes you're making can be something of a long winded stab in the dark, especially if you decide to utilise a platform such as PhoneGap… Or is it? let's shine a light on some tools and tricks.</p>

				<p>The browser used to be a meek sandbox, shut off from all the things that native apps could do. But now we&rsquo;ve grown up, and with WebGL, Canvas, Web Audio, Device Access and more, we have a lot of power at our fingertips. To really unlock this potential and make all this data dance, we need maths.</p>
