				<p>Feb 4th: 9.00am&mdash;5:00pm</p> 
			</h3>
	
<p>Join <strong>Brad Frost</strong> for a full-day, fully catered masterclass</p>		
<p>"We're not designing pages anymore. We're designing systems of components."</p>
<p> As with most things Stephen Hay says, he's right. Over the past few years, we've witnessed an explosion of Web-enabled devices, and that explosion has forced the Web community to embrace a more systematic approach to designing interfaces.</p>

<p>Take a deep dive into the world of responsive web design, how to deconstruct interfaces down to their atomic elements, and how to introduce design systems into your workflow. We'll look at a ton of emerging responsive patterns, new tools and resources to help you design multi-device Web experiences. Sound like fun? We hope so!
</p>

<h4>What you'll learn</h4>
<ul>
	<li>An overview of the ever-shifting Web landscape</li>
	<li>The fundamentals of responsive design and the principles of adaptive design</li>
	<li>The atomic design methodology and implementing atomic design with Pattern Lab</li>
	<li>The modern design workflow: process, techniques and tools</li>
	<li>The pros and cons of many emerging responsive design patterns</li>
</ul>

			</h3>
			
				<p>Mobile first and responsive web design aren't simply two great tastes that go well together. They represent much more than that. Mobile first responsive web design is the responsible way to build responsive design. It is the best way to build something that is both responsive from a layout AND a performance perspective.</p>

<p>But if mobile first is the right way to do responsive design, then why are so few people doing it? In this session, we'll dig into why mobile first responsive design matters and the techniques necessary to make it work.</p>

<p>In 2000, Jason Grigsby got his first mobile phone. He became obsessed with how the world could be a better place if everyone had access to all that information in their pockets. Those mobile dreams hit the hard wall of reality: WAP was crap. So Jason went to work on the web until 2007, when the iPhone made it clear the time was right. He joined forces with the three smartest people he knew and started Cloud Four.</p>
<p>Since then, he has had the good fortune to work on many fantastic projects, including the Obama iPhone App. A sought‐after speaker and consultant on mobile, Jason is founder and president of Mobile Portland, a local nonprofit dedicated to promoting the mobile community in Portland, Oregon.</section>

<p>“Let’s migrate our existing content, it will be fine for mobile.” It’s the line that strikes fear into the heart of any content strategist. And it happens all the time: your client expects their brand spanking new responsive site to make their crap content look good. Spending time reviewing, restructuring and rethinking what content should be on their site all sounds too hard. So what do you do? Where should you focus your energy so that the project is still a success? Sally will share three pieces of advice for the next time you are faced with this situation.	</p>	
	</section>
			
			<section class=bio><p>Sally is a Brisbane-based content strategist who likes big, messy web redevelopment projects. A word nerd at heart, she isn’t afraid of spreadsheets or metadata but hates the word migration. She often finds herself giving pep-talks to clients that they will have their content ready on time. Sally has a special interest in the author experience, and how writing for the web is evolving with technology, mobile and the rise of structure content.</p>			</section>

			<section class=description>
<p>The web has always had fragmentation, though not on the scale we're seeing now with new devices - and that's before we consider hybrid-touch laptops, microscreen smart watches, gesture interfaces or displays the size of a wall. Testing all the user permutations of your application is becoming almost impossible, so how do you go about working out whether you're delivering a good experience or not?</p>

<p>In this session, we'll look at the use of responsive design oriented analytics coupled with a few statistical methods that will help determine how well you're delivering your experiences and highlighting the areas you need to focus on next in order to maintain a decent level of coverage.</p>			</section>

<p>Responsive design and modern CSS techniques have rapidly transformed the web from the 960 pixel wide  place it was only a few years ago, bringing beautiful, usable web experiences to our smartphones, tablets, phablets, i-things and other devices of all shapes and sizes. With more and more of our customers carrying their email around in their pocket we need to provide an equally beautiful experience for email on mobile devices. This talk will cover responsive techniques you can apply to your HTML emails that overcome some of the challenges of email client rendering engines, as well as some tips for designing your emails to work well with these techniques.</p>			</section>

			</h3>
			
			<section class=description>
			<p>We as designers, and our users have long since become comfortable with how to navigate most desktop websites. But what should happen to your sidebar, or header navigation when the screen shrinks? In this session we'll hear about the latest Responsive navigation patterns, help make sites as easy to navigate on a smart watch as they are on 4D TVs (ok, maybe on phones, tablets as well as desktops).</p>

<p>David is driven by the need to understand and innovate how things work in the ever changing world of web development, and has been trying to make things look good on computers since tinkering with a ZX Spectrum in his Birmingham bedroom way back in the 1980s.</p>

<p>For the last 15 years he has worked for various companies in the UK and Australia, from small agencies to big media. He now works as a Senior Front-end Developer for Bigcommerce and is the co-founder of SydCSS. He has also been known to release mobile games that hark back to the 80s era.</p>			</section>

			<section class=description>
				<p>Many of us were not working on the Web when the ideas that underpin Responsive Web Design were born. John was. Indeed, his article from the year 2000, "A Dao of Web Design", a quote from which  Ethan Marcotte begins his rightly famous article outlining (and naming) RWD called for designers to see the Web as new, more fluid medium, free from many of the constraints of the print world. In this presentation John looks back at the Web of the late 1990s, and asks what can we learn from those days, today.</p>
			</section>

			<section class=bio>	
			<p>With a background in computer science and mathematics, and a great deal of good fortune, John Allsopp’s life collided with the web in the early 1990s.</p>

			<p>For nearly 20 years he has developed software for web developers, built web sites and applications, written books like Developing with Web Standards and the first ever book on Microformats, and written countless articles and tutorials for print and online publications.</p>

			<p>In 2000, he wrote “A Dao of Web Design”, which over a decade later continues to be widely cited as the theoretical foundation for Responsive Web Design.</p>

<p>When we create for the web, we participate in a kind of public art. We code, we design, we build for an audience, shaping digital experiences that provide a service, or that create joy, or that simply connect readers with words written half a world away. But in this session we’ll revisit what we’ve learned about responsive design, and ensure our content, not just our design, is readily accessible to them wherever and whenever they are. In doing so, we’ll look at some ways in which our audience reshapes the way we think about our medium, and see where they might be leading us—and the web—next.</p>			</section>

			<section class=bio><p>Ethan Marcotte is a designer/developer who is passionate about beautiful design, elegant code, and the intersection of the two. He cofounded Editorially, and over the years his clientele has included People Magazine, New York Magazine, the Sundance Film Festival, and The Boston Globe. Ethan coined the term “responsive web design” to describe a new way of designing for the ever-changing web and, if given the chance, will natter on excitedly about it—he even went so far as to write a book on the topic. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and would like to be an unstoppable robot ninja when he grows up.</p>
